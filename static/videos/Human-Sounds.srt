Welcome to our hospital.

00:00:03, 500 --> 00:00:06,400
You might encounter machines 
and equipment that make different noises. 

3
00:00:06, 800 --> 00:00:11,000
Iâ€™d like to play some sounds to get you 
familiar with the noises you might experience during your stay.

4
00:00:11, 600 --> 00:00:13,800
This first sound is an X-Ray machine. 

5
00:00:24, 500 --> 00:00:25,000
This is an IV pump

6
00:00:37, 600 --> 00:00:39,000
This is a Ventilator.

7
00:00:51, 700 --> 00:00:53,200
This is a heart rate monitor.

8
00:01:05, 500 --> 00:01:06,900
This is an MRI machine.

9
00:01:18, 500 --> 00:01:20,200
This is a blood analyzer.

10
00:01:32, 200 --> 00:01:34,000
This is a Respirator.

11
00:01:45, 200 --> 00:01:48,500
Lastly, this is the sound of an ICU alarm going off.

12
00:02:00, 000 --> 00:02:05,000
These are the most common sounds that you might hear. 
Feel free to ask me any questions and have a nice day.
